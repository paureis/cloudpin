# Roadmap

Each version below is a [milestone](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/milestones) with a target date and the
issues it ships. Dates are aims, not promises: a fix can go out in a patch release at any time, and anything that
slips moves to the next version with the reason in its issue. Open an
[issue](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues) to vote for an idea or suggest one.

## 0.4.x: early-tester fixes (week of 2026-10-12)

Whatever the first outside testers find, fixed before 1.0. 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 shipped the fixes found before testing
began (see Shipped).

## 1.0.0: launch (target 2026-10-16)

The `.cloudpin.yml` format is stable from 1.0 on. Everything that changes it shipped in 0.2.0 to 0.3.0.

- **A week of real use** by the author and early testers, then 1.0.0 and the launch
  ([#9](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/9)).
- **Tested inside every agent** ([#2](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/2),
  [#3](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/3)): Cursor, Gemini CLI and Copilot CLI.
- **Go-public checklist closed** ([#8](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/8)).

## 1.1.0: Claude Code plugin and MCP server (target 2026-10-23)

- **Claude Code plugin and MCP server** ([#15](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/15)): one-click install,
  and read-only tools agents can call to check the account before acting.

## 1.2.0: GitHub Action (target 2026-10-30)

- **GitHub Action** ([#10](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/10)): `cloudpin check` before deploy jobs.

## 1.3.0: installers (target 2026-11-06)

- **Homebrew** ([#16](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/16)), **Scoop and winget**
  ([#17](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/17)).

## 1.4.0: `cloudpin switch` (target 2026-11-13)

- **`cloudpin switch`** ([#14](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/14)): move every CLI to the pinned
  accounts in one go, after one confirmation.

## 1.5.0: editor status bar (target 2026-11-20)

- **VS Code / Cursor status bar** ([#18](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/18)): a green or red pin
  showing whether the active accounts match the project.

## Ideas (not scheduled yet)

An idea gets a version when work on it starts.

- **More CLIs** ([#11](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/11)): `terraform` workspaces, `doctl`, `flyctl`,
  `firebase`, `heroku`, `stripe`, `netlify`.
- **Wrangler against a real Cloudflare login** ([#56](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/56)): the Cloudflare
  support is built to Wrangler's source and docs and tested with fakes; it waits for someone with a Cloudflare
  account to try it.
- **Team policy:** a shared file that requires certain projects to be pinned.
- **Fish and Nushell** wrappers.
- **OpenSSF Best Practices silver, then gold** (passing since 2026-10-08,
  [project 15321](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/15321)). Silver is mostly writing: governance, a code of
  conduct, a threat model, signed releases and 80% test coverage, plus a second person who could keep the project
  going. Gold needs other contributors: two-person review of most changes and a bus factor of two.

## Shipped

- **0.4.2** (2026-10-10): a clearer first run: `init`, `status` and `doctor` call a CLI you don't have "not
  installed" ([#75](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/75)).
- **0.4.1** (2026-10-09): bash and zsh wrappers that keep guarding when an alias of the CLI already exists, and warn
  about an alias that runs another program ([#69](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/69)); pin files from a
  newer cloudpin say to update ([#67](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/67)); GitHub Releases carry only
  the release files ([#65](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/65)).
- **0.4.0** (2026-10-09): signed GitHub Releases with build provenance
  ([#53](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/53)), branch protection visible to Scorecard
  ([#54](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/54)), hand checks of the protected-environment prompt and the
  Claude Code "ask" ([#55](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/55)), and exempt commands that run with a
  broken pin file ([#62](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/62)).
- **0.3.1** (2026-10-09): the update notice and `cloudpin version` ([#50](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/50)),
  and no false Supabase warning outside a project ([#48](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/48)).
- **0.3.0** (2026-10-09): Supabase and Cloudflare Wrangler ([#37](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/37)),
  `cloudpin doctor` ([#35](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/35)), `cloudpin explain`
  ([#36](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/36)), and the Cursor hook fix
  ([#42](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/42)).
- **0.2.1** (2026-10-08): releases published from GitHub Actions with provenance
  ([#19](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/19)), OpenSSF Scorecard
  ([#20](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/20)) and CodeQL.
- **0.2.0** (2026-10-08): environments and protected environments ([#12](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/12)),
  Kubernetes for `kubectl` and `helm` ([#13](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/13); standalone `kustomize`
  never contacts a cluster, so it isn't guarded), Vercel monorepos and large teams
  ([#4](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/5)), command
  parser gaps ([#7](https://github.com/paureis/cloudpin/issues/7)), and safety-review fixes.
- **0.1.0** (2026-10-08): first public beta.
