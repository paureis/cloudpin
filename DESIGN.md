# cloudpin — design

> A seatbelt for your cloud CLIs: stops you, or your AI agent, from running commands on the wrong account.

Decisions reached in the design interview of 2026-10-07. Anything marked **(verify)** must be checked
against current official docs during the build, not assumed.

## Problem

`az`, `aws`, `gcloud`, `vercel` and `gh` silently act on whichever account was logged in last. With
several accounts on one machine, a deploy or delete lands on the wrong one. AI agents make it worse:
they run these commands for you and never ask.

## Why this project

Before choosing it we checked the alternatives (October 2026): session-replay viewers, claim checkers,
hallucinated-package guards and knowledge-cutoff updaters each already have 3 to 7 open-source versions.
We found no popular standalone tool for per-project cloud account pinning.

## Decisions

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Name | `cloudpin` (free on npm; avoided "cloudguard", a Check Point product) |
| Stack | TypeScript on Node, published to npm, works on Windows, macOS and Linux |
| Config | Committed `.cloudpin.yml`; pins stable IDs, with friendly names as comments; created by `cloudpin init` from the current logins |
| CLIs | az (subscription + tenant ID), aws (account ID), gcloud (account + project ID), vercel (team ID), gh (user + host) |
| Terminal | Shell wrappers for bash, zsh and PowerShell, enabled by one line in the shell profile; plus `cloudpin check` for scripts and CI |
| Speed | Identity results cached; cache invalidated when the CLI's own config/credential file changes |
| Agents | Every agent with a real blocking pre-command hook (Claude Code, Cursor; Codex, Gemini CLI and Copilot CLI **(verify)**), via `cloudpin install-hook <agent>`. Agents without a blocking hook get documented `cloudpin check` integration, never a fake hook |
| Block rule | On mismatch, block every command except login, logout, switch, whoami, `--version` and help |
| Override | `CLOUDPIN_SKIP=1` works in the terminal; ignored in agent-hook mode |
| Scope | The full product at launch; iterate on issues afterwards |
| License | MIT |
| Authorship | Commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude`; the README says it was built with Claude Code as a pair programmer |

## Edge cases

- No `.cloudpin.yml` found: cloudpin does nothing.
- Monorepos: the nearest `.cloudpin.yml`, searching upward from the current folder, wins.
- A pinned CLI isn't logged in: block, with the message "log in as X".
- A pinned CLI isn't installed: skip it.
- A command picks the account itself (`--subscription`, `--profile`, `--scope`, `--project`, or env vars such
  as `AWS_PROFILE` / `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT`): check that account, not the default one.
- cloudpin only ever reads identity, never prints tokens, and never logs in or changes accounts.
- A pin file uses a section or key this version doesn't know: refuse it (fail closed, since it may be a typo that
  would leave a CLI unguarded) and say it may need a newer cloudpin, naming the running version (#67). From 1.0 the
  format only adds names, so this is how a teammate on an older version finds out.

## Repo and release

- `paureis/cloudpin`, public since 2026-10-08. The owner chose to go public before the checklist below was
  complete, to stop private-repo Actions minutes; it is now the bar for **1.0.0** instead. Personal details were
  removed first: a fresh repository with the history rewritten (author emails, paths), the session notes
  (`HANDOFF.md`) kept local, and the original repository archived privately.
- Before 1.0.0, all of these:
  1. Every CLI and every supported agent tested on real accounts (Windows), with the nightly Windows run green.
  2. About a week of the owner using it on real projects.
  3. Safety review: read-only, no token output, switching never blocked.
  4. README with a short animated demo, one-line install, clean uninstall, and the origin story.
  5. `cloudpin` 1.0.0 published to npm.
  6. **Disk cleanup (owner request, 2026-10-08):** delete the test tools folder `~/.cloudpin-testbed`
     (gcloud and agent CLIs installed only for testing), `dist/`, any `cloudpin-*`/`tmp.*` folders left in the
     temp directory, and stale git worktrees; report the space freed to the owner.
  7. Personal details out of the repo (done 2026-10-08); private vulnerability reporting on (`SECURITY.md` links
     to it); the README images and badges render on GitHub and npmjs.com.
- Then: make it public, pin it on the profile, post a launch (r/devops, r/ClaudeAI, Show HN).
